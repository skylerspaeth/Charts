# Helm Charts

### NOTE: Archiving as this was just a thought experiment and I decided to use local charts instead.

This repo is the home of the custom Helm charts I run in my home lab.

## Installation
To install one of these Helm charts, first enable this repo:
```bash
# tbd
# helm repo add skylerspaeth https://skylerspaeth.github.io/charts
```

## Charts
The following charts are currently included in the repo:
- `homeauto`: Deploys and configures my home automation services
- `gameservers`: Deploys Minecraft and CS:GO servers
